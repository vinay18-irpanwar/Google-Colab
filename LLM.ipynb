            "    *   Think of it as a single column of a DataFrame.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Powerful Data Manipulation:**\n",
            "    *   **Data Reading/Writing:** Easily read data from various formats like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, HDF5, etc., and write DataFrames back to these formats.\n",
            "    *   **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing data (NaN values), drop or fill rows/columns, remove duplicates.\n",
            "    *   **Data Transformation:** Apply functions, map values, create new columns, change data types.\n",
            "    *   **Indexing and Selection:** Sophisticated methods for selecting subsets of data based on labels, positions, or conditions (`.loc`, `.iloc`).\n",
            "    *   **Grouping and Aggregation:** Perform \"split-apply-combine\" operations (e.g., `groupby()` followed by `sum()`, `mean()`, `count()`).\n",
            "    *   **Merging and Joining:** Combine multiple DataFrames similarly to SQL joins (`merge()`, `concat()`).\n",
            "    *   **Reshaping:** Pivot, unpivot, stack, unstack DataFrames.\n",
            "    *   **Time Series Functionality:** Robust tools for working with date and time data.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Integration:**\n",
